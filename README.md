#PYMACEUTICALS

This project uses matplotlib and pandas to analyze the data of a pharmaceutical company. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens on mice with tumors. The analysis focused mainly on the demographics of the mice, in addition to their tumor volume at different timepoints during the study (based on drug regimen).
